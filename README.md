In this project we aim to create a web application that can run on mobile and on desktop with the following functionality:

Allow parents/admin to create chores/tasks and asssign them a value

Allow children/users to claim a chore 

For future improvement it could also include features like:
Send notification to users when new chore is availablle
Collect payment for claimed chore
Limit number of chores that can be claimed at the same time by the same user
Set an expiery timer for chores (for example empty diswasher or setting table may only be availalbe for 15 minutes or so)
